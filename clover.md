#### A place to include explain my personal projects for Clover EFI Bootloader

#### First is Clover Special Edition

#### Short story
#### Clover Special Edition was created in 2014 with the agreement of [Slice](https://sourceforge.net/u/slice2009/profile/) because I asked permission to build a package including a USB installer for OS X Yosemite. This was the first USB Installer for macOS including Clover EFI create from commands to build Clover, at that time it was very revolutionary because Clover EFI was not used and known as he now.
